            <h2>Investigation and Plan</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I knew I wanted to try a sleep tracker of some kind, so I began by researching ways to have a working (and correct) clock. Initially, I looked at the Arduino UNO Rev4 because it featured an internal clock, and wifi, which would be neccesary to automatically update the time without user intervention. However, I realised that an Arduino, which is programmed in C++, would not reach the course requirements of using python or javascript. Furthermore, as I'm unfamiliar with C++, it would have added an unneccesary learning curve and lengthened the time it would take to complete the project.</p>
            <p>I then looked at connecting the micro:bit to a webpage on a computer, which would display the hours slept. I discovered that through WebUSB (which is the same technology that allows code to be automatically uploaded to the micro:bit by the browser) could theoretically be used to do this. However, I found it would be overly difficult and unneccesary as a better solution would be using a second microbit, connected to the computer via serial usb, to send the data to the computer. This solution is not only simpler but allows the main micro:bit to be a distance away from the computer. Though I would eventually replace this in the final project, with a wifi based solution.</p>
            <p>Using what I had learned in class about datalogging with the micro:bit, I made a quick prototype that was essentially a timer which would log the hours slept after you stop it. However, a more complete version of the project would need some sort of internet connection to act as an alarm clock, not only a timer. I found the ElecFreaks IOT:BIT, which is an expansion board, designed for the micro:bit, which adds wifi capabilities. With this, I could use the internet to update the time, to upload the data, and display it on a web app, the original vision for the project. The plan at this stage was to create a wifi connected smart alarm clock that would track the hours slept and prompt the user to enter their mood. This data would then be displayed on a web app for the user to view.</p>
